2025-11-29 01:47:38,535 - INFO - [ORCH_THOUGHT] I need to decompose the research task into testable hypotheses.

Based on the request, I will investigate three main directions:
1. Method X applicability
2. Method Y optimization
3. Hyperparameter Z sensitivity
I will launch agents to test these concurrently.

2025-11-29 01:47:43,292 - INFO - [THOUGHT] I need to verify this hypothesis using a Python script.
I will create a synthetic dataset and run a simple regression model.
Then I will analyze the coefficients to check the relationship.
